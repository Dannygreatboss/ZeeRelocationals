      <h3>1. Start Early</h3>
      <p>Preparing for a move can feel overwhelming, but breaking it down into manageable steps 
        makes the process smoother. Here’s a breakdown of essential steps to help you prepare 
        for your move:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make a checklist of tasks to complete before the move.</li>
        <li>8 Weeks Before: Declutter and downsize</li>
        <li>7 Weeks Before: Gather packing materials</li>
        <li>6 Weeks Before: Choose a moving company</li>
        <li>5 Weeks Before: Pack non-essential</li>
        <li>4 Weeks Before: Notify parties of your move</li>
        <li>3 Weeks Before: Finalize packing</li>
        <li>2 Weeks Before: Confirm logistics with your movers</li>
        <li>1 Week Before: Pack up the rest.</li>
        <li>Moving Day: Ensure everything is packed and ready for transport.
          After Your Move: Unpack and review</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Declutter and downsize</h3>
      <p>Declutter and Downsize. Declutter first. Sort through your items. Go room by room, 
        decide what you no longer need, and donate, sell, or discard things you won’t be taking with you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Gather packing materials</h3>
      <p>Gather Packing Materials. Get strong, sturdy boxes in various sizes (Wade rope, Large, Medium and Dish pack boxes). 
        Packing paper and bubble wrap for wrapping fragile items. Packing Tape to secure your boxes. Markers to label boxes 
        with the contents and the room they belong to. Furniture Pads to protect large furniture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Choose a moving company</h3>
      <p>Choose a Moving Company. If you decide to hire professionals, research each company, get quotes and 
        read reviews. Make sure they offer the services you need (packing, disassembling furniture etc.). 
        Book in advance to secure your moving date as early as possible, especially if you're moving during 
        peak times (summer or weekends).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Pack non-essential</h3>
      <p>Start packing non-essentials. Sort through your belongings, and start packing non-essentials. 
        This helps you feel prepared and ready early on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Finalize packing</h3>
      <p>Finalize Packing: Pack Smart. Start with the least used rooms and items then work towards the essentials. 
        Wrap delicate items like glassware, electronics, and artwork with bubble wrap or blankets. Mark each box with 
        the room and contents. 
      Gather important paperwork, such as your passport, medical records, and any legal documents. These should 
      be kept in a separate, easily accessible folder during the move.

      If you have pets, make arrangements for their travel.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Confirm logistics</h3>
      <p>Confirm details with your moving company. Ensure all the services you need are included in the moving contract 
        (e.g., packing, moving heavy and fragile items, disassembly of furniture).  Arrange for any last-minute logistics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Pack up the rest.</h3>
      <p>Pack up the rest. Pack an Essentials Box. This should contain everything you’ll need for the first night or two, 
        such as toiletries, a change of clothes, snacks, and any important documents. Clean your home and if possible, clean 
        your new home before the move-in date. This makes it easier to unpack and settle in. Also think about how you want 
        the furniture placed so that you can direct the movers accordingly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Moving Day</h3>
      <p>On moving day, ensure everything is packed and ready for transport. Be sure that  dressers and furniture are empty 
        and ready to be moved. Do a final walkthrough check every room, closet, and cupboard to ensure nothing you want with 
        you is left behind. Make sure someone is at both locations (your old home and new home) to oversee the move. 

        <br>After your move, unpacking can be overwhelming. Focus on one room until it’s done before moving to the next. 
        Start with essentials. Unpack your essentials box and prioritize rooms that you’ll use right away, like 
        the kitchen and bathroom.

        <br>Inspect the items delivered and your new home for any damage or issues. Review your moving company.
        
        By following these steps, you can make your move more organized, efficient, and less stressful</p>
